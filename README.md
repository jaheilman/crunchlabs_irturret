### iturret-anti-magazine-spike

mikey hack that prevents the iturret from spiking/throwing/RUD'ing the magazine when powering the turret on or homing it.

if your iturret is pointed upward at enough of an angle, when it is turned on or when you home it, the motion will be so fast that the magnets on the magazine will not be sufficient to hold the magazine in place. the turret will "spike" (in the football sense of spiking a ball) the magazine.
